        <p class="Paragraph">Nobody can be and cannot be one and at the
           same time and I am. I am Simon Kathembe. Kim is a name which most of
            my friends refer me by.
        </p>
        <p class="Paragraph">Currently, I am a student in <a href="http://www.moringaschool.com">
          Moringa School</a> a Software development
           accelerator boot-camp located along Ngong’ Rd, Nairobi, Kenya. Before
           Moringa, I was a student in <a href="http://www.uonbi.ac.ke">The
          University of Nairobi</a>, School of
          Business taking Bachelor of Commerce, majoring in Business
          Information System Management. Oh, I’m also a proud alumnus of
          <a href="http://www.makueniboys.ac.ke">Makueni Boys’ High School</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="Paragraph">Exposure to fields like Design, Technology, Business and Data Science
           has given me quite an interesting viewpoint to the world. I love to
           see things in perspective of technology and design. This perspective
           has landed me in the software development field which is my major
           hobby and interest. Apart from software development, I also have
           interests in Business Analytics and Agri-business. My hobbies run
           from swimming to playing pool-table and chess and also travelling.
