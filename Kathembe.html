      <p class="Paragraph">Nobody can be and cannot be one and at the
         same time and I am. I am Simon Kathembe. Kim is a name which most of
          my friends refer me by.
      </p>
      <p>Currently, I am a student in <a href="http://www.moringaschool.com">
        Moringa School</a> a Software development
         accelerator boot-camp located along Ngong’ Rd, Nairobi, Kenya. Before
         Moringa, I was a student in <a href="http://www.uonbi.ac.ke">The
        University of Nairobi</a>, School of
        Business taking Bachelor of Commerce, majoring in Business
        Information System Management. Oh, I’m also a proud alumnus of
        <a href="http://www.makueniboys.ac.ke">Makueni Boys’ High School</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Exposure to fields like Design, Technology, Business and Data Science
         has given me quite an interesting viewpoint to the world. I love to
         see things in perspective of technology and design. This perspective
         has landed me in the software development field which is my major
         hobby and interest. Apart from software development, I also have
         interests in Business Analytics and Agri-business. My hobbies run
         from swimming to playing pool-table and chess and also travelling.
